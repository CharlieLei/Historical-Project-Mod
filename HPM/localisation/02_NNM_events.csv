EVTNAME10222;$YEAR$年法兰西革命;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10222;愤怒的群众冲上街道，与宪兵发生冲突，国王已经无从选择，只能逃出皇宫;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10223;拿破仑政变;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10223;面对总统选举的落选，路易-拿破仑・波拿巴在军队支持下发动政变，夺取皇位。;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10224;拿破仑三世被废黜;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10224;普法战争的失败的消息传遍巴黎，毫无疑问，我们的皇帝拿破仑三世被废黜了。;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11108;Slavic Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11108;The call has gone out for the Slavic nations of the Balkans to finally unite under a common banner, to resist the encroachment of the Austrians and Turks as well as other European powers. Yugoslavia, it is said, will be a power to rival even its most powerful neighbours. Whether this new nation would succeed in holding together a people divided by centuries of bitter warfare is best left for speculation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13000;We will allow the westerners into $COUNTRY$, so long as they cause no trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13000;They bring dangerous ideas. $COUNTRY$ will refuse them all access.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13010;Shipwrecked Sailors;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13010;An old pond\nA frog jumps in \nThe sound of water.'\n\n-- Matsuo Basho\n\nOne of our coastal provinces is bustling with rumors about the strange people who were found along its shorelines earlier this morning. The more precise origin of these shipwrecked sailors is as of yet uncertain, but, wherever they are from, they are definitely not from $COUNTRY$. The difficulty now lies in deciding what to do with them: if we send them home, we are effectively changing our policy of non-interaction with the westerners. Ignoring them and allowing them to stay, however, means permitting a western presence in $COUNTRY$ despite all our efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA13010;Send them home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB13010;Allow them to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13015;Foreign Smugglers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13015;One of our subjects has been discovered wearing foreign clothes, and further interrogation by the authorities has lead to the slow unraveling of a foreign smuggling ring. These foreigners come into $COUNTRY$ without permission, knowing they face execution should they be caught-- yet some of our advisors say there are benefits to their presence, as they can supply needs to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people that we cannot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13020;Foreign Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13020;Despite our policy of not permitting foreigners into $COUNTRY$, it has been discovered that a group of foreign missionaries has been traveling among our people and spreading their religion. While we have every right to execute them out of hand, this does raise the possibility of a confrontation with their home country. Do we wish to risk such a war, all for the sake of a few priests?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13030;Western Approaches;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13030;News reaches us that an expatriate community of foreigners, from various European countries and Great Powers, has formed in one of our cities. Doubtlessly, this is a direct effect of our government's policy of open ports and borders. This influx might be positive, as our government seems to believe, however some voices have less kind things to say about the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13040;Despite the obvious rightness of our country's trade policies, greater amounts of foreign goods could be useful, and elements within our administration have suggested setting up a limited trading post in one of our coastal cities, where foreign ships can moor and trade, without compromising the cultural integrity of $COUNTRY$. It could be an economic boon to the area and the nation, but conservative voices warn that destructive foreign influences might further creep into our society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13050;A sweet, pungent stench hangs over the backstreets and alleys in one of our cities, emanating and spreading in every direction from an epicenter at the foreign trade station. The European traders have brought with them the habit of opium smoking, and our subjects have taken to it on a scale that threatens to become epidemic. It seems that, for every new ship that lands, more and more of our people get caught in the deadly and pacifying web of addiction. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13056;The great clippers ply our coastlines from north to south, like wolves culling out the weak and the corruptible with the poison they sell. Wherever there is an unexposed harbor, a foreign ship soon docks, and drives another fang into our national body. The use of opium has spread throughout $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13070;Rangaku', literally translated as 'Dutch learning', and by extension 'Western learning', is a Japanese word used to describe a particular body of knowledge and learning imported from the west via a Dutch trading station at Dejima. Something similar has ocurred at the trading station in one of our provinces, where local officials are busy translating western books and treatises on science, advancing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ science and understanding of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13080;He hides his face and speaks with controlled anger. A local aristocrat has been insulted by one of the foreigners living in one of our provinces. Apperantly, the foreigner in question failed to bow in the appropriate manner when passing the aristocrat on the street. Shall we tolerate such blatant ignorance of our customs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13090;He unveils the device with the excitement of a child. - 'You can see their eyes!', he cries, pointing excitedly at the jar of beetles. He instructs you to look into the object -- the glass and metal is cold against your face -- there, in curves of an optic lense, reality is magnified ten times over. - 'It's a microscope!, he laughs. - 'I bought it from one of the foreigners!';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13140;Some intelligence concerning our military preparations has spread from the military mission in one of our provinces, severely hurting our war effort. We have expelled the members of the mission, but the damage has already been done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13160;Sailors winding up drunk in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ prisons aren't normally affairs of state, but this is an exception. A navyman from one of the Great Powers has been arrested by officials in one of our cities, after having murdered one of our subjects in what appears to have started as a bar fight. The diplomatic attach?insists that the sailor be handed over to the country in question, and tried according to their laws. This presents us with a conundrum. Granting this privilege once is tantamount to allowing extraterritoriality to all foreign subjects, but not doing so might very well cause international uproar. This issue merits careful consideration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13230;Wandering alone in the streets of $CAPITAL$ can be a dangerous thing, as a foreign ambassador in the Legation Quarter recently found out. Guards report having found him dead at 4 a.m. in the morning, apperently the vicitm of a robbery, however the foreigners accuse us of having failed in our supposed responsibility to protect their diplomats. We fear that even a formal apology will not be enough to placate them, however, something more tangible might...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13280;The reforms sweeping through our country have upset the landed elites in one of our cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13365;Boxers Occupy Foreign-Held Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13365;The Righteous Society of Harmonious Fists have invaded lands currently owned by a colonial power, but which rightfully belong to the Chinese. More than that, they have successfully occupied the territory and rebuffed efforts by westerners to take it back. We can attempt to stake our claim over the land once again," though if we do it is all but tantamount to a declaration of war-- and, considering the state the Qing Empire is in", it might be a war in which we stand to lose more than we gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13370;The Boxers Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13370;$CAPITAL$ has been occupied by the Righteous Society of Harmonious Fists, who have successfully driven foreign influence out of the country and restored it to its traditional policies of isolationism. What repercussions this will cause with the western powers remains to be seen, but for the moment the Empire stands triumphant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18501;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Way;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18501;Ours is a nation of equality, where no man is placed above another in importance. Everyone strives for the betterment of all. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a wealthy but criminal industrialist has served not to outrage the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, but rather to reinforce their ideals. Today our people walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18505;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Ingenuity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18506;Ours is a nation of liberty, where every man is born with the inherent right to seek his own destiny. The possibility of prosperity lies within every man's reach. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the acquittal of a man popularly believed to be innocent has served to reinforce our peoples' ideals. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18510;Military Parade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18510;In the eyes of our soldiers as they parade through the streets, nothing can be seen but utmost devotion to $COUNTRYNAME$ and the ideals for which our nation stands. These men, and the description fits them, have been fostered since childhood into rigid and firm belief in our nation, and they would die to defend it. Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18511;Ours is a nation of might, where a man's strength determines his success and everyone knows very well how superior we are to our neighbours. None can hope to compare to $COUNTRY$ on our best day. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the execution of a foreigner believed to have been engaged in criminal activities on $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soil has served to reinforce our peoples' beliefs. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18515;Send in the Troops;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18515;Matters in $COUNTRY$ are getting out of hand. Acts of violence are becoming more commonplace, and some claim that revolution is in the air. Many citizens in $CAPITAL$ are calling on the government to take stronger measures. Sending our army to deal with the violence will, however, only bring the attention of the world upon us. Perhaps this is a time to prove that $COUNTRY$ can deal with its affairs in the way we always have-- with civility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18517;Ours is a nation of order, where peace and civility rule the day. Everyone strives for the common good, and for the progress of our nation as a whole. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a prominent criminal figure who had previously eluded authorities has not outraged the people, but rather has served to reinforce their beliefs. Today the people of $COUNTRY$ walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18521;Brotherhood of Man;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18521;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: peace, brotherhood and fraternity. Such were the virtues this man believed in, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18525;Liberty Shines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18525;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: freedom, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Such were the virtues in which this man believed, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18530;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18531;A recent dispute with one of our neighbours has had an electrifying effect upon the people of $COUNTRY$: 'How can they be allowed to treat us this way?', they ask. Some are calling for war, while others are satisfied with the knowledge that our nation has already come out on top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18550;Rejecting Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18550;Our people have attempted to embrace the ideals of westernization for a long time, but now there is a growing movement to return to the traditional $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. It falls to the nation's leaders to set the example: should we embrace the ideal of tradition once again, or should westernization remain our goal despite our continuing isolation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18551;Embracing Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18551;Our people have held to our traditions for a very long time. After many years of exposure to the western nations, however, a growing movement has begun to change the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. Intellectuals in $CAPITAL$ say the government should lead the people into an era of progress and not remain mired in our backward ways. Shall we throw these fools into prison, or consider what they have to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18555;Clash of Ideals;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18555;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have clashed with members of the aristocracy in $CAPITAL$. The aristocracy has accused the intellectual elite of attempting to cast aside the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life, while the intellectuals say that progress is necessary if $COUNTRY$ is to have any chance against western imperialist powers. The argument of the intellectuals is convincing, but this has not calmed matters in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18556;New Ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18556;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have brought several new ideas before the court, ideas that could advance our research considerably. They are also quite contentious, however, and a rejection of the intellectuals could do much to soothe the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18560;Annals of the Past;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18560;The peasants are taking to the streets, rising up against their rulers in ways that would have been unthinkable only decades ago. Perhaps it is time to remind them of their duty to their nation, and of the traditions which have served $COUNTRY$ so well in ages past?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18562;The Fight Against Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18562;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionaries have begun heated debates in one of our states, arguing that $COUNTRY$ should not be slavishly seeking to chase after 'civilized' nations-- indeed, that already $COUNTRY$ has gone too far down the path of degradation and that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people suffer for it. They are calling on the government to repeal reforms, or at the very least to slow down the rapid pace of change... and they are gaining a wide audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18565;A Return to Western Influence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18565;$COUNTRY$ is a nation of progress, and our current period of insulation against the western powers runs contrary to that ideal. Shall we call on the borders to be opened once again? It might anger some of our people, but the flow of goods and ideas is invaluable to our prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME18571;Rejecting the West?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC18571;We never wanted this contact with the westerners. They bring too many problems into our country, and their influence spreads like an insidious disease. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court are calling for the borders to be closed once again, for us to display to these imperialists that they cannot simply strut about our nation as if they own it. A display of force is necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44356;加拿大国家铁路二期工程;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44356;连接卡尔加里和大西洋沿岸的加拿大国家铁路二期工程竣工，现在末期工程要动工了。末期工程线路最长、施工难度最大，因为铁路要穿越落基山脉。;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44808;Not unexpectedly, Mexico has ignored the terms of the Treaties of Velasco-- claiming that Santa Anna only agreed to them under duress. Indeed, Santa Anna himself has been quick to back up their claim even despite his precarious position. The one bright light in this? It might be the cause the American government has been looking for to intervene in our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46304;索拉诺的野心;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46304;巴拉圭独裁者索拉诺・洛佩斯盯上了拉普拉塔河出海口地区。巴拉圭需要夺取大西洋出海口，而不是得到乌拉圭人许可辗转多次的内河航运才能出海。凡事不可能一帆风顺，尽管巴西很可能会干涉，但现在是展示我大巴拉圭的肌肉，建立大巴拉圭帝国的时候了 !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME60160;国家诞生;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC60160;今日，群众聚集在$CAPITAL$欢庆$COUNTRY_ADJ$独立。在现代世界中，独立可以昙花一现，因此我们必须好好享受这一珍贵的时期。今天，$COUNTRY_ADJ$国旗飞扬在每一块窗户与角落之间，欢欣鼓舞的国民们高唱$COUNTRY_ADJ$国歌。好一片共同祈愿美好明天的盛景。;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80111;东干盆地;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80111;既然偏远新疆的叛乱已经平息，现在东干盆地的归属问题又浮出水面。贪婪的俄国不仅已占据盆地的西半部――卡拉塔尔，还觊觎着东部的伊犁。我们是应该直接将盆地和平地让给俄国，还是为$COUNTRY_ADJ$荣誉而战呢？;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90034;回归希腊;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90034;是时候与我们的希腊同胞一起携手并进了！.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95076;一月起义;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95076;波兰年轻人反抗被征入俄国军队的一场自发的抗议立即演变成了一场大面积的叛乱，这场叛乱正受到波兰与立陶宛籍的政治家与高阶军官的支持。全欧洲都在看着我们，如果我们过于严厉地镇压这场叛乱，很有可能会损害我们与其他欧洲列强的关系。然而如果我们不这样做的话，无异于是在助长起义的嚣张气焰。;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95315;加入加拿大联邦？;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95315;由于$COUNTRY$步履维艰，有些国民开始讨论起加入加拿大联邦的可能性。加拿大联邦是一片自由之土，如果我们在一起的话将比各自为政更强大。我们要与他们的政府接洽吗？;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95316;$FROMCOUNTRY$要求加入加拿大;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95316;来自$FROMCOUNTRY$的一名代表已经秘密地与加拿大政府接洽，要求允许一个前美国州加入联邦。尽管这看起来像个好主意，但是如果同意的话美国政府可能会把我们看成是搞从中渔利的机会主义。;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96090;$COUNTRY_ADJ$君主制终结;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96090;随着$COUNTRY$在最近的战争中战败，$COUNTRY_ADJ$君主制备受责难-- 已经有多次暗杀企图，并且政府内部呼吁君主制下台。公众的意见转向将$COUNTRY$变为民主制这一论调…尽管有些人担心这会使国家陷入进一步的混乱。;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96215;印度民族主义者的胜利！;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96215;在印度，民族主义者成功占据$COUNTRY_ADJ$殖民地。我们的统治者被赶走，领土丧失。;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97571;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97571;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98000;Border Dispute with the Zulu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98000;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced. We must either back down and apologize, or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98001;The South African Union ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98001;The time has come to consider joining the South African union. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98002;Annexation of the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98002;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrasing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98003;The Anglo-Boer War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98003;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98004;South Africa is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98004;We control the entire Cape Colony. There is no question now as to who the masters are in South Africa: the Boers. The time has come for us to end the war and unite the Boers under a single flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98005;Appeal From $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98005;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98006;The Boer Exodus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98006;With 'the Great Trek' underway, many of the Boers are eager to leave the Cape Colony behind and travel to either the Transvaal or the oranje Free State where they feel they will be free to pursue their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98735;Islamic Fervor in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98735;A sentiment of Islamic nationalism is sweeping $COUNTRY$, as people begin to clamor for unification with the Islamic Caliphate. We have little reason to doubt that they would object to a petition of annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
